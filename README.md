# Boston-Hacks-2024
## Shape Identification AI

Our submission for the Boston-Hacks-2024 Hackathon.

The premise of the project was to build a full stack web application that would take in user submitted images and feed them into Microsft Azure Custom Vision AI, trained on a dataset of five thousand shape images.

Originally we were supposed to have a shape drawing function that unfortunately was not able to be implemented due to time constraints and a JSON import function to allow users to train the AI directly from JSON files.

If we had more time we would've implemented both of those features, allowing the user to train the AI however they wished and allowed the AI to recognize any particular shape of their choosing.
